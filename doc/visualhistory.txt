VISUAL-HISTORY                                        *visual-history*

This plugin is in an initial testing phase. While it should always be
functional, anything can change at any time and documentation maybe lacking.

TRAVERSING THE VISUAL SELECTION HISTORY                            *vishist1*

In visual and in normal mode, 4 commands are defined:

                                        *[v*
[count][v               Reselect [count] previous visual selections

                                        *]v*
[count]]v               Reselect [count] next visual selections

                                        *[V*
[V                      Reselect first visual selection

                                        *]V*
]V                      Reselect last visual selection


Note that the visual history is only updated when the cursor moves (in any
mode). For example, a single press of `V` to select an line can't be
immediately reselected with the above commands (although |gv| will still work).


The following Ex command is also available:

                                *:ClearVisualHistory*
:ClearVisualHistory     Remove all visual history for the local buffer


SETTINGS                                                           *vishist2*

PREVENT AUTOMATIC CREATION OF MAPPINGS                             *vishist2.1*

                                   *g:visual_history_create_mappings*
By default |visual-history| creates the above mappings. If you would rather it
didn't do this (for instance if you already have those key combinations mapped
to something else) you can turn them off with:

    let g:visual_history_create_mappings = 0

And map them to something different with:

    <mode>map <your-map-here> <Plug>(<OperationToMap>)

For reference, the default mappings are as follows:

    " visual mode commands
    vmap <silent> [v <Plug>(SelectPrevious)
    vmap <silent> ]v <Plug>(SelectNext)
    vmap <silent> [V <Plug>(SelectFirst)
    vmap <silent> ]V <Plug>(SelectLast)

    " normal mode commands
    nmap <silent> [v <Plug>(SelectPrevious)
    nmap <silent> ]v <Plug>(SelectNext)
    nmap <silent> [V <Plug>(SelectFirst)
    nmap <silent> ]V <Plug>(SelectLast)


SPECIFY THE LENGTH OF THE VISUAL HISTORY                           *vishist2.2*

                                   *g:visual_history_length*
By default |visual-history| remembers your last 100 visual selections. To
change this default, add this to your .vimrc:

    let g:visual_history_length = <any number greater than 0>
